# 2) Treat the input as a string and read a 4-character string and take it apart as you did with
# the integer above. Use the same prompt as you did for the first problem so it looks like it
# was an integer but it is not an integer but a string. Use the index of the string to get the
# characters.

# 1) Display a prompt for 4-digit integer
int_num = input("Please enter 4-digit integer number: ")

# 2) Treat the number as a string and print each index per line.
for num in int_num:
    print(num)
