# 4) The body mass index (BMI) is used to estimate the risk of weight-related problems based on a subjectâ€™s height and mass.
height_in_feet = float(input("Enter your height in feet: "))

mass_in_pound = int(input("Enter your mass in pounds: "))

# Convert height to all inches
total_height_in_inch = height_in_feet * 12 + height_in_inch

# Convert mass from pound to kg

# Convert height in inches to meters
